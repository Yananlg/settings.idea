      <item value="These two are needed so that the server" />
      <item value="Note that while some implementations of {@code InputStream} will return the total number of bytes in the stream, many will not. It is never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream." />
      <item value="Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next invocation of a method for this input stream. The next invocation might be the same thread or another thread. A single read or skip of this many bytes will not block, but may read or skip fewer bytes." />
      <item value="Return the name of the parameter in the multipart form. @return the name of the parameter (never {@code null} or empty)" />
      <item value="Return the original filename in the client's filesystem. This may contain path information depending on the browser used, but it typically will not with any other than Opera. @return the original filename, or the empty String if no file has been chosen in the multipart form, or {@code null} if not defined or not available" />
      <item value="Number of milliseconds to delay before the first execution of a {@link #fixedRate()} or {@link #fixedDelay()} task." />
      <item value="The string representation of the expected value for the properties. If not specified, the property must &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be equal to {@code false}. @return the expected value" />
      <item value="Convenience annotation for clients to enable Eureka discovery configuration (specifically). Use this (optionally) in case you want discovery and know for sure that it is Eureka you want. All it does is turn on discovery and let the autoconfiguration find the eureka classes if they are available (i.e. you need Eureka on the classpath as well)" />
      <item value="Execute the annotated method with a fixed period in milliseconds between the end of the last invocation and the start of the next. @return the delay in milliseconds" />
      <item value="matches when the specified classes are on the classpath." />
      <item value="This allows for the possibility that {@link InputStream#read(byte[], int, int)} may not read as many bytes as requested (most likely because of reaching EOF)." />
      <item value="Reads the requested number of bytes or fail if there are not enough left." />
      <item value="Return whether one or more of the given profiles is active or, in the case of no explicit active profiles, whether one or more of the given profiles is included in the set of default profiles. If a profile begins with '!' the logic is inverted, i.e. the method will return true if the given profile is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; active. For example, &lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;env.acceptsProfiles(&quot;p1&quot;, &quot;!p2&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt; will return {@code true} if profile 'p1' is active or 'p2' is not active. @throws IllegalArgumentException if called with zero arguments or if any profile is {@code null}, empty or whitespace-only" />
      <item value="ObjectMapper provides functionality for reading and writing JSON, either to and from basic POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), or to and from a general-purpose JSON Tree Model ({@link JsonNode}), as well as related functionality for performing conversions. It is also highly customizable to work both with different styles of JSON content, and to support more advanced Object concepts such as polymorphism and Object identity. &lt;code&gt;ObjectMapper&lt;/code&gt; also acts as a factory for more advanced {@link ObjectReader} and {@link ObjectWriter} classes. Mapper (and {@link ObjectReader}s, {@link ObjectWriter}s it constructs) will use instances of {@link JsonParser} and {@link JsonGenerator} for implementing actual reading/writing of JSON. Note that although most read and write methods are exposed through this class, some of the functionality is only exposed via {@link ObjectReader} and {@link ObjectWriter}: specifically, reading/writing of longer sequences of values is only available through {@link ObjectReader#readValues(InputStream)} and {@link ObjectWriter#writeValues(OutputStream)}." />

      <item value="Whether to force the encoding to the configured charset on HTTP requests. Defaults to true when &quot;force&quot; has not been specified." />

      <item value="Hint for that an {@link EnableAutoConfiguration auto-configuration} should be applied after other specified auto-configuration classes." />
      <item value="Specifies the domain within which this cookie should be presented. The form of the domain name is specified by RFC 2109. A domain name begins with a dot (&lt;code&gt;.foo.com&lt;/code&gt;) and means that the cookie is visible to servers in a specified Domain Name System (DNS) zone (for example, &lt;code&gt;www.foo.com&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;a.b.foo.com&lt;/code&gt;). By default, cookies are only returned to the server that sent them." />
      <item value="Defines callback methods to customize the Java-based configuration for Spring MVC enabled via {@code @EnableWebMvc}. {@code @EnableWebMvc}-annotated configuration classes may implement this interface to be called back and given a chance to customize the default configuration." />
      <item value="Declares a container wrapping the response. Valid values are &quot;List&quot;, &quot;Set&quot; or &quot;Map&quot;. Any other value will be ignored." />
      <item value="A list of tags for API documentation control. Tags can be used for logical grouping of operations by resources or any other qualifier. A non-empty value will override the value received from {@link Api#value()} or {@link Api#tags()} for this operation." />
      <item value="Corresponds to the `summary` field of the operation. Provides a brief description of this operation. Should be 120 characters or less for proper visibility in Swagger-UI." />
      <item value="Corresponds to the 'notes' field of the operation. A verbose description of the operation." />
      <item value="Specifies a reference to the response type. The specified reference can be either local or remote and will be used as-is, and will override any specified response() class." />

      <item value="upports model inheritance and polymorphism." />
      <item value="Classes will be introspected automatically as they are used as types in operations, but you may want to manipulate the structure of the models." />
      <item value="For backward compatibility" />
      <item value="It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread. If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized externally." />
