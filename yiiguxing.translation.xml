      <item value="ObjectMapper provides functionality for reading and writing JSON, either to and from basic POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects), or to and from a general-purpose JSON Tree Model ({@link JsonNode}), as well as related functionality for performing conversions. It is also highly customizable to work both with different styles of JSON content, and to support more advanced Object concepts such as polymorphism and Object identity. &lt;code&gt;ObjectMapper&lt;/code&gt; also acts as a factory for more advanced {@link ObjectReader} and {@link ObjectWriter} classes. Mapper (and {@link ObjectReader}s, {@link ObjectWriter}s it constructs) will use instances of {@link JsonParser} and {@link JsonGenerator} for implementing actual reading/writing of JSON. Note that although most read and write methods are exposed through this class, some of the functionality is only exposed via {@link ObjectReader} and {@link ObjectWriter}: specifically, reading/writing of longer sequences of values is only available through {@link ObjectReader#readValues(InputStream)} and {@link ObjectWriter#writeValues(OutputStream)}." />
