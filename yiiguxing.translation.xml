      <item value="Creates a new auxiliary resource file for writing and returns a file object for it. The file may be located along with the newly created source files, newly created binary files, or other supported location. The locations {@link StandardLocation#CLASS_OUTPUT CLASS_OUTPUT} and {@link StandardLocation#SOURCE_OUTPUT SOURCE_OUTPUT} must be supported. The resource may be named relative to some package (as are source and class files), and from there by a relative pathname. In a loose sense, the full pathname of the new file will be the concatenation of {@code location}, {@code pkg}, and {@code relativeName}." />
      <item value="Creates a new source file and returns an object to allow writing to it. The file's name and path (relative to the {@linkplain StandardLocation#SOURCE_OUTPUT root output location for source files}) are based on the type to be declared in that file. If more than one type is being declared, the name of the principal top-level type (the public one, for example) should be used. A source file can also be created to hold information about a package, including package annotations. To create a source file for a named package, have {@code name} be the package's name followed by {@code &quot;.package-info&quot;}; to create a source file for an unnamed package, use {@code &quot;package-info&quot;}." />

Hash salting is now expected to be based on if the {@link AuthenticationInfo} returned from the {@code Realm} is a {@link SaltedAuthenticationInfo} instance and its {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.SaltedAuthenticationInfo#getCredentialsSalt() getCredentialsSalt()} method returns a non-null value. This method and the 1.0 behavior still exists for backwards compatibility if the {@code Realm} does not return {@code SaltedAuthenticationInfo} instances, but &lt;b&gt;it is highly recommended that {@code Realm} implementations that support hashed credentials start returning {@link SaltedAuthenticationInfo SaltedAuthenticationInfo} instances as soon as possible&lt;/b&gt;." />
      <item value="This is because salts should always be obtained from the stored account information and never be interpreted based on user/Subject-entered data. User-entered data is easier to compromise for attackers, whereas account-unique (and secure randomly-generated) salts never disseminated to the end-user are almost impossible to break. This method will be removed in Shiro 2.0." />
