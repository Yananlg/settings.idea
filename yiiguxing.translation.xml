      <item value="Interface to be implemented by any object that wishes to be notified of the link ApplicationContext that it runs in. &lt;p&gt;Implementing this interface makes sense for example when an object requires access to a set of collaborating beans. Note that configuration via bean references is preferable to implementing this interface just for bean lookup purposes. &lt;p&gt;This interface can also be implemented if an object needs access to file resources, i.e. wants to call code getResource, wants to publish an application event, or requires access to the MessageSource. However, it is preferable to implement the more specific link ResourceLoaderAware, link ApplicationEventPublisherAware or link MessageSourceAware interface in such a specific scenario. &lt;p&gt;Note that file resource dependencies can also be exposed as bean properties of type link org.springframework.core.io.Resource, populated via Strings with automatic type conversion by the bean factory. This removes the need for implementing any callback interface just for the purpose of accessing a specific file resource. &lt;p&gt;link org.springframework.context.support.ApplicationObjectSupport is a convenience base class for application objects, implementing this interface. &lt;p&gt;For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the link org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory BeanFactory javadocs." />
      <item value="The Generated annotation is used to mark source code that has been generated. It can also be used to differentiate user written code from generated code in a single file. When used, the value element must have the name of the code generator. The recommended convention is to use the fully qualified name of the code generator in the value field . &lt;p&gt;For example: com.company.package.classname. The date element is used to indicate the date the source was generated. The date element must follow the ISO 8601 standard. For example the date element would have the following value 2001-07-04T12:08:56.235-0700 which represents 2001-07-04 12:08:56 local time in the U.S. Pacific Time time zone.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The comment element is a place holder for any comments that the code generator may want to include in the generated code.&lt;p&gt;" />

Notice that if the same time field appears more than once in a pattern, the fieldPosition will be set for the first occurrence of that time field. For instance, formatting a Date to the time string &quot;1 PM PDT (Pacific Daylight Time)&quot; using the pattern &quot;h a z (zzzz)&quot; and the alignment field DateFormat.TIMEZONE_FIELD, the begin index and end index of fieldPosition will be set to 5 and 8, respectively, for the first occurrence of the timezone pattern character 'z'. return the string buffer passed in as toAppendTo, with formatted text appended." />

Finally, &quot;!My-Header&quot; style expressions indicate that the specified header is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;i&gt; supposed to be present in the request. &lt;p&gt;Also supports media type wildcards (), for headers such as Accept and Content-Type. For instance, &lt;pre class=&quot;code&quot;&gt; &amp;#064;RequestMapping(value = &quot;something&quot;, headers = &quot;content-type=text&quot;) &lt;pre&gt; will match requests with a Content-Type of &quot;texthtml&quot;, &quot;textplain&quot;, etc. &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supported at the type level as well as at the method level!&lt;b&gt; When used at the type level, all method-level mappings inherit this header restriction (i.e. the type-level restriction gets checked before the handler method is even resolved)." />
